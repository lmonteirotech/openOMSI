//! The parts coupled behind a vehicle: the rear sections of an articulated bus and a lorry's
//! trailers. Behind the player's vehicle (the one with a [`RigidBody`]) every road part is a
//! body of its own on the same wheel physics, with its own `.bus` file's mass, inertia,
//! centre of gravity, axles and springs, held to the part in front by its joint
//! (`crate::rigid::Joint`, `[coupling_front_character]`), as Omsi.exe runs each section: what
//! the rear section weighs, brakes, drives and leans comes back to the front. The parts of the
//! AI's vehicles, of other players' over the LAN and of a train on rails follow kinematically,
//! hung on their coupling and pitched towards the ground under their axle - and so do all of
//! them with `OMSI_KINEMATIC_TRAILERS=1` (A/B).
