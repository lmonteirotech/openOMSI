//! View sync: the one place that turns the simulation's state into renderer instances (see
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, "Target layering"). The AI traffic and the people simulate in
//! omsi-sim and know nothing of the GPU; what they look like is here:
//!
//! * `traffic`: the AI vehicles' renders, their drivers and the traffic light lamps;
//! * `people`: the people's meshes, posing and skinning, the coins and the ticket blocks.
//!
//! [`sync`] is the frame's view sync. The window runs it twice a frame, each time where the
//! part it brings up to date used to be synced: the traffic at the end of its step (before
//! the player and the people move: parking cars leave the traffic's list there, which the
//! people's step reads), the people at the end of theirs. The offscreen run calls it at the
//! same points, and before each picture it takes.
//!
//! The view's state is [`SimView`], kept apart from the simulation wrappers (`Traffic`,
//! `Humans` hold only the simulation's side): the window has it in `GfxState::sim_view`, the
//! offscreen run in its own struct. Two kinds of renderer change still happen inside the
//! wrappers' calls, at the moment the simulation makes them, so that the renderer sees the
//! same calls in the same order: a car's renders are made or let go as the traffic puts it
//! on the road or takes it off, and the people who appeared or went are shown at the end of
//! every `Humans` call that made them (`Humans::show_bodies`). Those calls take the part of
//! the `SimView` they change (`&mut TrafficView`, `&mut PeopleView`) as a parameter.
